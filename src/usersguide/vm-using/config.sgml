<title>Defining Virtual CPU Types</title>

<para>
Using the attribute <filename>cpu_mode</filename> it is now possible
to configure a guest CPU to be as close to host CPU as possible. 
The attribute value can have two values (which are taken from 
<ulink url="http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU">
Libvirt Documentation</ulink>):
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
host-model: The host-model mode is essentially a shortcut to copying host CPU definition from 
capabilities XML into domain XML. Since the CPU definition is copied just before starting a 
domain, exactly the same XML can be used on different hosts while still providing the best 
guest CPU each host supports. Use this mode if you need to migrate virtual machine.
It is not possible to use the cpu_match attribute described below when in this mode.
</para>
</listitem>


<listitem>
<para>
host-passthrough: With this mode, the CPU visible to the guest should be exactly the same 
as the host CPU even in the aspects that libvirt does not understand. Though the downside 
of this mode is that the guest environment cannot be reproduced on different hardware.
This is the default mode, if you don't need migration capabilities but just speed use this 
mode.
</para>

<para>
The attribute cpu_match can be used to specify a specific topology or model type for the cpu.
The value of the cpu_match attribute is compose of a two parts divided by a colon. The first 
part (before the colon) is used in the attribute match of the tag cpu (see 
<ulink url="http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsCPU">Libvirt Documentation</ulink> 
for more details). While the second part if present will be copied between the two cpu tags.
So for example if the cpu_match attribute value is: 
</para>

<screen>
<![CDATA[
exact: <model fallback='allow'>core2duo</model><vendor>Intel</vendor><topology sockets='1' cores='2'/>
]]>
</screen>


<para>
Then the xml used for libvirt will be:
</para>


<screen>
<![CDATA[
<cpu mode='exact'>
  <model fallback='allow'>core2duo</model><vendor>Intel</vendor><topology sockets='1' cores='2'/>
</cpu>
]]>
</screen>
